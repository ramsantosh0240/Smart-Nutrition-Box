#“ESP32-S3 IoT project that monitors temperature, humidity, gas, and weight using ThingSpeak cloud.”
# 🧠 Smart Nutrition Box

An IoT-based system that monitors food storage conditions using an ESP32-S3 microcontroller.  
It measures **temperature**, **humidity**, **gas concentration**, and **weight**, then uploads data to **ThingSpeak Cloud** for live analysis.
